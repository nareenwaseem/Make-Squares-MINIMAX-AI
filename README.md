# Make-Squares-MINIMAX-AI

AI mini-project implements a basic MINIMAX algorithm to create a playing agent for the game "Make Squares." The game, a zero-sum two-player challenge, is played on an MxN grid where players take turns connecting dots to form squares. The AI uses the H2O framework and the MINIMAX algorithm to evaluate and execute moves, aiming to outscore the opponent. The project includes a graphical interface built with Tkinter to visualize the game and interact with the AI agent.
